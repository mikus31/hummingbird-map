## Mapping Project Topic Ideas

**INTERACTIVE HURRICANE TRACKING MAP**

Potential repo name for this project: cane-tracking-map 

**Focused Topic**

The idea is to design a map that reveals a more insightful potential track of an approaching hurricane in an effort to find out the extent and depth of damage in and near the predicted path in order to help the map user or audience understand better how truly destructive a hurricane can be, especially for those away from the eyewall.

It’s the foundational concept of quantitative geography -and happens to be a convenient rationalization for glowing symbology.

Things rarely just end abruptly -they make a difference to their surroundings. **This is why I grate a little when I see hurricane maps with fine solid crisp one-dimensional lines sweeping out the path of the eye.**

The concept behind this interactive map is to create a hurricane tracking map that more-accurately reflects the size of the storm's impact beyond the track of the eye of the storm.

**INTERACTIVE RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD MAP**

Potential repo name for this project: hummingbird-map 

**Focused Topic**

The idea is to design a map that shows the yearly migration patterns of ruby-throated hummingbirds in North America in an effort to find out how the pattern varies from year-to-year in order to help the map user or audience discern if variables (man-made, environmental, etc.) are affecting yearly migrations.

**Draft Description**

The map will connect points of equal dates, or dates within ranges, to create hummingbird migration contour lines. See the roughly-sketched graphic below:

![hummingbird contours](/images/hbird-contours.png "Hummingbird Contours Map")

After these contour lines are collected and refined, the data can be stylized and the map animated to produce a wave-like effect northward across North America. This animation can be done for each year individually, for all years collectively, or by individual months (see [John Nelson's iceberg map](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/iceberg-map-part-2-animation/) for an example). Allow the user to choose the parameters by providing these options. 

This modern, unique way of visualizing the data is designed to enhance the exposure of the data collecting sources and therefore attract more attention and participants in future data collection efforts. In the process, it also may reveal some interesting patterns or anomalies regarding ruby-throated hummingbird northward migrations.

**DRAG-AND-DROP GEOGRAPHY GAME**

Potential repo name for this project: drag-drop-geog

**Focused Topic**

The idea is to design a map that allows users to test their geographic knowledge of the United States in an effort to discover the state of geographic literacy among Americans in order to help the map user or audience understand better the importance of maintaining and/or strengthening geographic curriculum in the United States.

**Draft Description**

The game would present users with a basemap of the United States of America and a set of random or categorized shapes. Users would be asked to drag-and-drop these shapes (rivers, cities, monuments, parks, etc.) where they think each is located. 

For the categorized option, users could choose from a number of different thematic games. These categories could include a National Parks game or a major rivers of America game, for example.

In addition to game options, users also could select a difficulty rating. This would allow the game to be advertised to all ages, and therefore extend its audience.

At the end of the game, users would be given a score based on how accurate each feature placed is to its actual location. This score can be calculated using the difference, in miles, between the centroids of the user-placed features and the centroids of the correct feature locations. The post-game report also could highlight a user's best and worst placement.

Users would also be given a percentile at the end of each game to show where they rank among all those who have played the same game to date. 

Finally, users would be given the option to share their score with friends and family through their social media applications.
