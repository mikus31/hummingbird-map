# New Maps Plus Master's Degree Project
Michael McNeil's final mapping project for the New Maps Plus Master's Degree program at the University of Kentucky.

## Mapping Project Topic Ideas

**INTERACTIVE HURRICANE TRACKING MAP**

Potential repo name for this project: cane-tracking-map 

**Focused Topic**

The idea is to design a map that reveals a more insightful potential track of an approaching hurricane in an effort to find out the extent and depth of damage in and near the predicted path in order to help the map user or audience understand better how truly destructive a hurricane can be, especially for those away from the eyewall.

**INTERACTIVE RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD MAP**

Potential repo name for this project: hummingbird-map 

**Focused Topic**

The idea is to design a map that shows the yearly migration patterns of ruby-throated hummingbirds in North America in an effort to find out how the pattern varies from year-to-year in order to help the map user or audience discern if variables (man-made, environmental, etc.) are affecting yearly migrations.

**Draft Description**

The map will connect points of equal dates, or dates within ranges, to create hummingbird migration countour lines. See the roughly-sketched graphic below:

![hummingbird contours](/images/hbird-contours.png "Hummingbird Contours Map")

After these contour lines are collected and refined, the data can be stylized and the map animated to produce a wave-like effect northward across North America. This animation can be done for each year individually, for all years collectively, or by individual months (similar in nature to [John Nelson's iceberg map](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/iceberg-map-part-2-animation/). This way of visualizing the data would, potentially, enhance the exposure of the sources and therefore attract more participants in future data collection efforts.

**The Data**

Data from Hummingbirds.net:

  * [Ruby-throated Hummingbird First-bird Reports](http://www.hummingbirds.net/map.html)
  
Data from Journey North:

  * [Hummingbird, Ruby-throated (FIRST)](https://maps.journeynorth.org/map/?map=hummingbird-ruby-throated-first&year=2019)

**DRAG-AND-DROP GEOGRAPHY GAME**

Potential repo name for this project: drag-drop-geog

**Focused Topic**

The idea is to design a map that allows users to test their geographic knowledge of the United States in an effort to find out how good/poor geographic literacy is among Americans in order to help the map user or audience understand better the importance of maintaining and/or strengthening our geographic curriculum in the United States.
