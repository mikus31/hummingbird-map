Final mapping project for the New Maps Plus Master's Degree program.

Nascent Project Topic Ideas:

**HURRICANE TRACKING MAP**

From ---> https://adventuresinmapping.com/2016/10/17/firefly-cartography/

> The glow effect, while providing a distinct aesthetic, and perhaps hijacking some primitive cognitive wires, is a fitting example of Waldo Tobler‘s First Law of Geography: “everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” Or, the effect a thing has on its surroundings dissipates with distance. It’s the foundational concept of quantitative geography -and happens to be a convenient rationalization for glowing symbology.

> For example, the impact that these military bases impart on their surrounding areas is quite strong on-base, and diminishes as you travel away (air and ground transportation noise, traffic impacts, employment draw to local residents, the visual impact on the land). Things rarely just end abruptly -they make a difference to their surroundings. This is why I grate a little when I see hurricane maps with fine solid crisp one-dimensional lines sweeping out the path of the eye.

Bold quotation above = Mapping project idea. Show hurricane path (Michael?) with a more accurate tracking vector, weighted on each side of the storm's track in proportion to the damage caused. Could collect data for multiple variables and allow users to cycle through each variable and remap the impact ... vars = economic, wind speeds, precip, storm surge, etc.

Similar to Tracking Harvey map? ---> https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/24/us/hurricane-harvey-texas.html

**INTERACTIVE RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD MAP**

Firefly map idea ---> Dynamic, interactive hummingbird migration map throughout North America (see this one for the data: http://www.hummingbirds.net/map.html).

**DRAG-AND-DROP GEOGRAPHY GAME**

Geography literacy a big problem in America ... what about an interactive geography game? Remember at trivia night in Slidell ... Polish friend challenging us to name cities of certain countries in Europe. Or the shapes of National Parks, rivers, monuments, etc. Users have to drag the feature to proper geographic location, and then get a score at the end telling them how close (or not!) they came to accurately placing the features on the map.
