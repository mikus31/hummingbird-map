# New Maps Plus Master's Degree Project
Michael McNeil's final mapping project for the New Maps Plus Master's Degree program at the University of Kentucky.

## Nascent Project Topic Ideas

**HURRICANE TRACKING MAP**

From ---> https://adventuresinmapping.com/2016/10/17/firefly-cartography/

> The glow effect, while providing a distinct aesthetic, and perhaps hijacking some primitive cognitive wires, is a fitting example of Waldo Tobler‘s First Law of Geography: “everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” Or, the effect a thing has on its surroundings dissipates with distance. It’s the foundational concept of quantitative geography -and happens to be a convenient rationalization for glowing symbology.

> For example, the impact that these military bases impart on their surrounding areas is quite strong on-base, and diminishes as you travel away (air and ground transportation noise, traffic impacts, employment draw to local residents, the visual impact on the land). Things rarely just end abruptly -they make a difference to their surroundings. This is why I grate a little when I see hurricane maps with fine solid crisp one-dimensional lines sweeping out the path of the eye.

Quotation above = Mapping project idea. Show hurricane path (Michael?) with a more accurate tracking vector, weighted on each side of the storm's track in proportion to the damage caused. Could collect data for multiple variables and allow users to cycle through each variable and remap the impact ... vars = economic, wind speeds, precip, storm surge, etc.

Similar to Tracking Harvey map? ---> https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/24/us/hurricane-harvey-texas.html

**Focused Topic**

I want to design a map that reveals a more insightful potential track of an approaching hurricane because I want to find out the extent and depth of damage in and near the predicted path in order to help the map user or audience understand better how truly destructive a hurricane can be, especially for those away from the eyewall.

**INTERACTIVE RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD MAP**

Firefly map idea ---> Dynamic, interactive hummingbird migration map throughout North America (see this one for the data: http://www.hummingbirds.net/map.html).

**Focused Topic**

I want to design a map that shows the yearly migration patterns of ruby-throated hummingbirds in North America because I want to find out how the pattern varies from year-to-year in order to help the map user or audience discern if variables (man-made, environmental, etc.) are affecting yearly migrations.

**DRAG-AND-DROP GEOGRAPHY GAME**

Geography literacy a big problem in America ... what about an interactive geography game? Remember at trivia night in Slidell ... Polish friend challenging us to name cities of certain countries in Europe. Or the shapes of National Parks, rivers, monuments, etc. Users have to drag the feature to proper geographic location, and then get a score at the end telling them how close (or not!) they came to accurately placing the features on the map.

**Focused Topic**

I want to design a map that allows users to test their geographic knowledge of the United States because I want to find out how good/poor geographic literacy is among Americans in order to help the map user or audience understand better the importance of maintaining and/or strengthening our geographic curriculum in the United States.
