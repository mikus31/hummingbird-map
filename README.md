# New Maps Plus Master's Degree Project
Michael McNeil's final mapping project for the New Maps Plus Master's Degree program at the University of Kentucky.

## Mapping Project Topic Ideas

**INTERACTIVE HURRICANE TRACKING MAP**

Potential repo name for this project: cane-tracking-map 

**Focused Topic**

The idea is to design a map that reveals a more insightful potential track of an approaching hurricane in an effort to find out the extent and depth of damage in and near the predicted path in order to help the map user or audience understand better how truly destructive a hurricane can be, especially for those away from the eyewall.

**INTERACTIVE RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD MAP**

Potential repo name for this project: hummingbird-map 

**Focused Topic**

I want to design a map that shows the yearly migration patterns of ruby-throated hummingbirds in North America because I want to find out how the pattern varies from year-to-year in order to help the map user or audience discern if variables (man-made, environmental, etc.) are affecting yearly migrations.

**DRAG-AND-DROP GEOGRAPHY GAME**

Potential repo name for this project: drag-drop-geog

**Focused Topic**

I want to design a map that allows users to test their geographic knowledge of the United States because I want to find out how good/poor geographic literacy is among Americans in order to help the map user or audience understand better the importance of maintaining and/or strengthening our geographic curriculum in the United States.
